    Movies can greatly affect our perception in some pretty wonderfull ways if you let them shape you that is, for me thsoe movie would be
      <ul>
         <li>Bhag Milkha Bhag</li>
         <li>Naruto</li>
         <li>Dragon balls</li>
      </ul>*Bhag milkha Bhag taught me not to give up and what can a sheer will do, it potrays for me that you can do anything with a single conviction for becoming better.
        <hr />
              *Naruto taugh me again not to give up and it showed no matter what your past is you can always be better in Future, It showed me the lonliness of someobody not understanding you, it showed how you can always be better.
        <hr />
         *Dragon ball specifically "Vegeta" that guy is something else in my life. He is the one who saved me when i was at my lowest in life, he taught me arrogance onself, to have pride in your linege.<br />
          He showed me what Hard work can achive, what a single conviction can do. I have couple of quotes from him to share<br />
         "You say I'm arrogant, I say damm right, that's pride, Pride of the saiyan I am, The prince of the ultimate warrior race"<br />
         "if sayain blood runs your veins and if you are my son as you claim then i will not tolerate you losing to anyone "YOU'LL BE THE BEST OR YOU'LL BE NOTHING""

   <p>Human mind is quite something if you were to look at lot things around you or within you,It's with and with not you at the same time, It's will play so many games with you if you don't take up control/put leash on it. 
         <ul>
            <li>If you give meaning ot your pain then it will hurt less </li>
            <li>If you have positive self talk with you daily then you'll be happy rather than sad most of the time.
            <li>You'll see opportunities in misery.</li>
            <li>You'll look for lessons in every experience.</li>
        </ul> 
            <li>If you think you can do it or not, your absolutly right,</li>
        </ul>  
    
             People with some mental disorders see the world differently than normal peoples because.
         <ul>
            <li>People with OCD have a lot of unwanted thoughts(by this I mean like jumping infront of bus,stabbing themselves) on a daily basis. But that doesn't mean they will act on it.</li>
            <li>People with ADHD have issues with having their attention in one thing, they have a hard time with organizing things,It may sound not that serious but imagine you can't focus all the time and keep on switiching form tasks to tasks.</li>
        </ul> 
   </p>

   <p>Music is something else it can lift you up and put you down at the same time.
